# Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree
Given an integer array nums where the elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a 
height-balanced binary search tree.

## Example 1:

Input: nums = [-10,-3,0,5,9]

Output: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5]

Explanation: [0,-10,5,null,-3,null,9] is also accepted


## Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,3]

Output: [3,1]

Explanation: [1,null,3] and [3,1] are both height-balanced BSTs.


## Constraints:
- 1 <= nums.length <= 10^4
- 10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
- nums is sorted in a strictly increasing order.

## Getting Started

Let's start to use this project.\
There is a python file with the code and a Jupyter Notebook to visualize the code execution in your browser.

### Prerequisites

Python 3 must be installed.

### Installation

To execute the project open the terminal and go to the project folder. Then execute it with python:

```sh
python3 array_to_BST.py
```

You can also use Jupyter Notebook to execute it in your browser or text editor directly.
